## Description

This is my personal capstone project for the Udacity Frontend Web Development Nanodegree Program.

The app uses the GeoNames API, Weatherbit API and Pixabay API to use fetch information about a the desired city to visit. Then it displays the output with the weather of the place, a related picture, and the information of the trip.

The project consist in working with asynchronous code in order to fetch data from many APIs and set a travel plan.
