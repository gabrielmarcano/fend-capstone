## Description

This is my personal project for the Udacity Frontend Web Development Nanodegree Program.

The app uses the MeaningCloud API to use Natural Language Processing in whatever blog you enter in the input, and it lets you know if the message is agreeing or disagreeing.

The project consist in working with asynchronous code in order to fetch data from the MeaningCloud API and use the NLP to evaluate sentences.
